		<title>intent filter for shaders</title>
		<body>Make intent filter for textures to not stack the textures. Make new intent filter for shaders with stacking. When kids try more and more texture packs at one point BL just crashes constantly and they cant handle clearing the cache and stuff like that. Make it so they are not stacking. Also make it so when they install BL for fist time and then use import activity, a texture would be active when they fire up  BL for the first time. Im the owner of a texture pack app that gave you over 1M downloads. You are posting bullshit on your twitter instead of reading it. The implementation of the things that im asking for should be really quick. </body>

		<title>With MCPE 0.13.1 creating a new mob render crashes BlockLauncher</title>
		<body>Creating a render crashes the game during startup of BlockLauncher. This only happens with the latest version of Minecraft PE 0.13.1. Before it worked correctly.  This is the code I had to comment out to make it stop crashing:  ``` javascript function addGrenadeRenderType(renderer) {     var model = renderer.getModel();      var head = model.getPart("head");     var body = model.getPart("body");     var rArm = model.getPart("rightArm");     var lArm = model.getPart("leftArm");     var rLeg = model.getPart("rightLeg");     var lLeg = model.getPart("leftLeg");      head.clear();      body.clear();     body.setTextureOffset(0, 0);     body.addBox(-1, 20, -1.5, 2, 4, 3);     body.setTextureOffset(8, 0);     body.addBox(-0.5, 20.5, 1.5, 1, 1, 1);      rArm.clear();      lArm.clear();      rLeg.clear();      lLeg.clear(); } var grenadeRenderType = Renderer.createHumanoidRenderer(); addGrenadeRenderType(grenadeRenderType); ```  Edit: by further research, commenting out this part made BL stop crashing:  ``` javascript     head.clear();      body.clear();     body.setTextureOffset(0, 0);     body.addBox(-1, 20, -1.5, 2, 4, 3);     body.setTextureOffset(8, 0);     body.addBox(-0.5, 20.5, 1.5, 1, 1, 1);      rArm.clear();      lArm.clear();      rLeg.clear();      lLeg.clear(); ``` </body>

		<title>Increase Texture Map Memory Space</title>
		<body>Hello,  I couldn't find a feature request section, but decided this was the best place since it does cause BL to crash.  If I install a few BIG MODS, I seem to find that about 256 or so textures seems to be the MAX that one can load.  If I use a MOD like Extended Craft (about 100+ textures) as well as hxRedStone (about 82 textures), that gets me almost there.  Then I added a few more to bump me over 256 textures and BlockLauncher "crashes".  Although if you are quick to read the error message, it is crashing because there are too many textures being added to the system.  So, can we please increase this?  With the new methods of adding textures is REALLY enhances the game TREMENDOUSLY!  Although, if you are trying to get your MCPE to be "just like" PC (with ExtendedCraft added), it is not really possible with the currently allocated memory footprint for the textures.  Thanks and I wanted to thank you for working on this!  It was certainly the best use of my Google Play Store funds (next to Minecraft itself!)! </body>

		<title>Server.getAddress() returns null all the time</title>
		<body>卓伟大大肯定会汉语。  我发现我在调用Server.getAddress()时候无论怎样都会返回null。  我尝试在newLevel事件中使用它，加入一个服务器后它返回null。  然后我又尝试使用Mobtick事件，在加入服务器30tick后查询服务器的地址，还是null。  我用pe的gui写了一个按钮，触发它输出Server.getAddress()的返回结果。  各种试，还是null。  我启动器的版本是1.8.2测试版。PE版本是0.10.4正式版。  望解决，谢谢。 </body>

		<title>Entity.getRider(ent) causes segfault</title>
		<body>Entity.getRider(ent) causes segmentation fault if ent is without a rider. Strangely, calling it on a killed entity works (in the tick the entity is killed, at least). </body>
