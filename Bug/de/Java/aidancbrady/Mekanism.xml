		<title>Drag and Drop of items with max itemStack bellow 64 from QIO System</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: When dragging an item that the max itemStack is bellow 64, it will actually drag 64. This is not a problem tho, as I can click on my inventory and it will only get the actual max itemStack of the item. But, if I drop the item on the ground instead of my inventory, I will get more than the possible max itemStack of the item (in this example, 64)  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Open your QIO System, put 64 upgrades from the same type (Speed Upgrade, for example) 2. Retrieve those 64 speed upgrades with a Drag and Drop, but don't drop it on your inventory, instead, click out of the inventory box to drop it on the ground [link to image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/554379889122213890/743236932754210877/unknown.png?width=447&amp;height=406) 3. The 64 stack will go right into your inventory [link to image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/554379889122213890/743237272903876618/unknown.png?width=442&amp;height=419)  #### Version: **Forge:** v1.16.1-32.0.88 **Mekanism:** v10.0.8.431 **Other relevant version:**  </body>

		<title>Comparator reading any bin makes it output a ridiculous redstone power level</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: The vanilla comparator reads a redstone power value higher than 15 when connected to a bin holding 69 or more items in it. This causes a major problem when trying to use a comparator to get the bin mostly full and turn off some production process. It will instead fill it to less than a stack because by then the level is already close to 15. Full bin Redstone Powers are below. Basic: 897 Advanced: 1,793 Elite: 7,169 Ultimate: 57,345 Creative: 469,726,049  #### Steps to reproduce: 1.place any tier Mekanism bin and fill it with 69 or more items. 2.place a comparator to read one of the sides of the bin. 3.look at the output face of the comparator with the player reticule 4.The One Probe will tell you the Redstone Power level the comparator is outputting.  Things to note: 1.The comparator still works like it should comparing and subtracting, so a basic bin with 69 items in it will output a RP of 16 but in substract mode with RP15 side input it will output RP1. Or the pictures below showing the full basic bin with the comparator in subtract mode. 897-15=882  ![2020-08-12_05 45 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8132047/90020697-0ad8a800-dc65-11ea-89ce-fd2e944646a3.png)  ![2020-08-12_05 45 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8132047/90020606-eda3d980-dc64-11ea-9334-ff2acb7fcb3f.png)  2.Redstone dust immediately truncates the RP down to a max of 15. 3.A Block between the comparator and the bin does not truncate the signal, it reads the same value. 4.comparators are able to chain the value together, and even use that as a side input.  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): Forge: 32.0.106 Mekanism,Additions,Generators,Tools-1.16.1-10.0.8.431 TheOneProbe-1.16-3.0.1-beta</body>

		<title>Modification Station leaves behind unusable block spaces when rotated via Configurator</title>
		<body>*Please use the search functionality before reporting an issue. Also take a look at the closed issues!*  #### Issue description: A Modification Station rotated by wrench leaves behind some kind of entity in the secondary block space (the part that moves from block to block while it is being rotated). No blocks can be placed in this space unless an op command is used to revert it to air, but it can be waterlogged. This block remains bugged if the station is removed without rotating back to the original position first.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Place a Modification Station 2. Use a Configurator in wrench mode to rotate it to any facing other than the original. 3. The block to the right of where it was originally aimed at to be placed is now bugged, and removing the station makes it permanent.  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 32.0.106 **Mekanism:** 10.0.8.431 ![2020-08-10_10 35 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6802445/89807551-08a40b80-daf6-11ea-93a2-da9095084613.png) ![2020-08-10_10 35 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6802445/89807604-1b1e4500-daf6-11ea-8503-a80dc1d4e6ff.png) ![2020-08-10_10 35 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6802445/89807615-21142600-daf6-11ea-9b1b-74a701db24ec.png) ![2020-08-10_10 36 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6802445/89807660-2ffad880-daf6-11ea-918a-189090d01ad2.png)</body>

		<title>Plastic slabs take extremely long to mine and some double slabs only drop 1 slab</title>
		<body>*Please use the search functionality before reporting an issue. Also take a look at the closed issues!*  #### Issue description: Tools used: primarily obsidian paxel. Some slabs were also tested with an obsidian pickaxe, diamond pickaxe, or wooden pickaxe, with no change in results. Slab varieties tested: All vanilla slabs, all Mekanism plastic slab varieties. All slabs were tested as single and double slabs. Results, mining speed: All vanilla slabs except warped and crimson break almost instantly with obsidian tools. When Mekanism plastic slabs are mined with a pickaxe, paxel, or other mining tool of any unenchanted speed, their time to be broken is extremely long, nearly as long as an obsidian block mined with an unenchanted diamond pickaxe, and no faster than when broken by bare hand. This applies to both single and double slab forms of the blocks. Results, drops: All single slabs drop 1 slab upon breaking. All vanilla double slabs drop 2 slabs. All standard Mekanism plastic double slabs drop 2 slabs. All glow and transparent plastic double slabs drop 1 slab.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Place all varieties of the game's slabs in the world in slab and double slab form, empty player inventory 2. Break slabs with a mining tool, noting the time taken for blocks to be broken. 3. Some double slabs will yield 2 slabs when broken, some will yield 1.  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 32.0.106 **Mekanism:** 10.0.8.431</body>

I built one, and after leaving the world and loading it back up one of the ports doesn't accept energy anymore, at also visually has no lightning anymore, but its not just visual, also the processing speed is slowed down. This seems to only happen when all ports are supplied with alot of energy. Here before placing an energy source the coil on the left has a lightning and transfers energy ![2020-07-18_19 20 59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38815969/87858254-ea028880-c92c-11ea-875c-1fcc3e7c6bd8.png) here after placing it it does neither ![2020-07-18_19 21 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38815969/87858274-08688400-c92d-11ea-996f-2faf0c85335d.png)  #### Steps to reproduce: 1.

		<title>Heat transfer of the reactor via heat conductors</title>
		<body>I think that the function of heat dissipation from a nuclear reactor through thermodynamic conductors breaks the balance, nuclear reactors were originally supposed to be dangerous, there was always a risk of explosion, while through thermodynamic conductors you can give away all the heat, and in any case there will be no risk of explosion. for example:  ![reactor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66527840/87289458-f46fed00-c4fc-11ea-9c92-698a0f9d59b5.png) this is my reactor transferring heat through the heat conductor to the thermoelectric boiler, it doesn't use any coolant and is 100% safe, in my opinion it should be nerfed.  and of course sodium as a coolant is completely unnecessary </body>

		<body>#### Issue description: The security access alterations made on Security Station are not immediately propagated to the UI and do not seem to take effect in, for example, letting the previously trusted player to open up the teleporter UI of a teleporter owned by someone who now denied access. The previously trusted player is still capable on right-clicking the teleporter and seeing its UI. The access status on the lock icon inside the UIs remains unchanged. Client restart is required for the changes to take effect for the affected payer.  This probably affects more than just teleporters, but we've tested only the teleporters for now.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. In a scenario with two players make player A trust player B via the Security Station. 2. Let player A place a teleporter and set it to a private frequency 3. Verify that the trusted player B is capable of opening the teleporter and seeing the private frequencies. 4. Make player A remove the player B from access roles in his Secutity Station 5. Player B is still capable of opening the teleporter UI 6. Restart player B client 7. Player B is no longer capable to access the teleporter UI, which should have been the case from the very moment of player A changing the permissions.  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 31.2.5 **Mekanism:** Mekanism-1.15.2-9.10.7.420</body>

		<title>Logistical Sorter Filter - Priority only matters for the first item pull</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: Just as the title says. Say I have a material filter set up to gather everything related to stone, so stairs, slabs, etc., but I want the actual normal stone in a chest on it's own.  To do that, I set up tag filter using forge:stone to sort all whole, uncrafted stones to a separate chest, and put that filter to the top of priorities. It works as intended, but only if the logistical sorter is handling ONE stack at a time. If I insert multiple stacks, or switch it to single item pulling, it starts alternating between the two rules. So if I have normal andesite, half of it will go into the stone-only chest, the other half will get sorted under the material filter.  This has to be a bug right? Or am I just stupid and missing a really obvious way to turn this off? I don't have round robin on, if that means anything.  ![setup1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/657943/82040294-b09c6b00-96a6-11ea-9915-8fecca635c86.PNG) ![setup2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/657943/82040372-cad64900-96a6-11ea-873a-1810a41c633b.PNG) ![setup3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/657943/82040475-eccfcb80-96a6-11ea-8e97-d5cfa4c73d7c.PNG)   Example with Slate, which is a forge:stone tagged block. Note that I changed the colour of my second filter from red to green after taking the setup screenshots. ![setup result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/657943/82040604-1ee12d80-96a7-11ea-98d8-b01227d16523.PNG)    #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Make any broad filter in a sorter 2. Make a more specific filter that covers an item already covered by the previous filter. 3. Place second filter higher in priority (This step currently makes no differrence other than for the very first item pull). 3.

		<title>[1.15.2] [9.10.3.416] Digital Miner can be run with zero power, when first placed</title>
		<body>When you place a digital miner, it doesn't initially require any energy to run. You can define a filter, then start mining, and it will both display 0FE/t in the gui and actually _require_ 0FE/t to mine and pull up items. If you toggle silk touch, change the radius/height, or add an energy/speed upgrade (basically anything that triggers the per-tick value to change), it will display the correct value, and shut off if not enough FE is available.  Breaking and replacing the digital miner reset the value to the correct one.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Install forge/minecraft 2. Place a digital miner, this can be done in survival or in creative. 3. Define a filter (I just used a tag filter of *ore*), then start the machine. 4. Observe the listed 0FE/t cost, and how the machine is still actively mining up ores.  #### Versions: **Forge:** forge-1.15.2-31.1.74 **Mekanism:** Mekanism, Tools, Generators, Additions, all the latest (1.15.2-9.10.3.416) </body>

Attaching energy cubes directly to the machines works and the universal cables works with Mekanism machines but no other machines that I've currently tested with. Also the flux plugs visually attaches to the Cables if placed down next to them but if instead a cable is placed down next to the flux plug there is no visual update that the flux plug attaches to the cable.   #### Steps to reproduce: 1.

		<body>#### Issue description: When items are charged in a creative energy cube and are fully charged, the mod throws an NPE. Mekanism items don't show this behavior nor does charging the same items in any of the other Energy Cubes. One thing I noticed, the Creative Energy Cube still allowed fully charged non-Mekanism items to be inserted into the charge slot. The Creative Energy Cube didn't allow fully charged Mekanism items in the charge slot and none of the other Energy Cubes allowed fully charged items from any mod to be inserted into the charge slot so it appears that this is isolated to the Creative Energy Cube.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Obtain a non-Mekanism chargeable item (I tested with a Mining Gadget and a Refined Storage Wireless Crafting Monitor) 2. Place non-Mekanism item in the charge slot of a Creative Energy Cube 3. When the item is fully charged, check the logs  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): Tested both on a Dedicated Server and Single Player game Forge version: 1.15.2-31.1.71 Mekanism version: 1.15.2-9.10.2.415 Mining Gadgets version: 1.3.5 Refined Storage version: 1.8.3  Other mods loaded: Building Gadgets version: 3.3.5 Cucumber version: 1.15.2-3.0.5 Harvest Sprites version: 1.15.2-0.0.1 JEI version: 1.15.2-6.0.0.3 Journey Map version: 1.15.2-5.7.0beta1 McProfilerView version 1.0 Mystical Agriculture version: 1.15.2-3.0.3 Pam's Harvestcraft 2 Crops version: 1.15.2-1.0.3 Pane In The Glass version 1.15.2-1.2.1 Simple Farming version 1.15.2-1.2.7  #### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here: (_It's almost always relevant_) Log from the dedicated server: [latest.log](https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/files/4588509/latest.log) </body>

		<title>[1.15.2] Digital miner power consumption doesn't match displayed values</title>
		<body>There is something funky going on with the energy consumption numbers of the digital miner. Possibly, base energy consumption is correct when you first load a world, but changing anything quickly gets things out of whack. For instance: standard ore filter, radius of 32, mining from 0-100, silk touch off, when you first log into the game and look, it lists a power usage of "96.41FE/t." Turn silk touch on, and it shows 3.71kFE/t. Turn silk touch back off, and it shows 232.38FE/t. Drop 10 energy upgrades in and nothing changes. Turn silk touch on and off, it now shows a usage of 23.23FE/t, which is a 10x (as expected from the energy upgrades) reduction from before. Log out and back in again, and it shows 96.41FE/t again. Cycle the silk touch button again, and it's back to 23.23FE/t.  All that said, the actual usage is in line with the "first logged in" numbers. Actual usage in the above configuration is 96.41 (or 9.64 with the energy upgrades) for no-silk touch. Actual usage with Silk touch on is 385.64FE/t, which jives with the "4x" cost for silk touch that I have in my config.  In summary, there are three issues:  1. Energy consumption doesn't properly update when upgrades are placed, until something in the main page changes it (e.g. silk touch toggling).  2. Silk touch is _showing_ a 16x energy consumption increase, not a 4x increase (e.g. the square of my increase value). I tested this with a brand new config, and it did in fact go up to 36x with the default 6x increase.  3. Everything that is shown in the digital miner power usage is off by a factor of ~2.41 compared to actual consumption.   #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Place Digital Miner, energy source 2. Create a config, start the miner. 3. Observe disparities between actual and displayed consumption, observe silk touch causing a visual increase of (increase value)^2  #### Version: **Forge:** forge-1.15.2-31.1.74 **Mekanism:** Mekanism-1.15.2-9.10.2.415 **Other relevant version:** MekanismTools-1.15.2-9.10.2.415, MekanismGenerators-1.15.2-9.10.2.415, MekanismAdditions-1.15.2-9.10.2.415 </body>

Create ethylene gas cylinder piped into a Mek Gas Burning generator.  Power outputted from generator into an induction cube (to measure power input) 2.  3.

However, my induction cell is receiveing 72krf/t which is what you'd get if you multiplied J*2.5 rather than J*0.4.

		<title>[1.15.2] Vanilla hoppers get "stuck" while inserting into Mekanisms bins</title>
		<body>This issue seems to affect the insertion of items into Mekanism bins by vanilla hoppers; other insertion methods seem to work fine (Mekanism logistical transporters, the factory hopper from Engineer's Decor, etc. all work fine).   Starting with a bin that has &lt; one full stack of an item in it (so, &lt;64 for most items, but &lt; 16 for ender eyes, etc.), vanilla hoppers will insert that item until the "one full stack" amount is hit, then will get stuck. Even a hopper that is entirely full of that item cannot insert the 65th item(or 17th, etc. depending on the item). Once something else brings the item total to 65 (some other transfer method, manually placing a single additional item etc.), the hopper transfer resumes, and doesn't appear to stop anywhere else.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Start a modded game with only Forge and Mekanism. 2. Place a bin (anything except the creative bin, which obviously operates on a different principle) 3. Place a vanilla hopper on any side of the bin (shift-clicking it to 'attach' the hopper). 4. Fill the hopper with &gt; 1 stack of a particular item, say 3 stacks of stone. 5. Observer the hopper steadily filling the bin with stone, then stalling once the bin contains 64. 6. Place a single additional stone in the bin, and watch the hopper transfer resume.  #### Version: **Forge:** forge-1.15.2-31.1.46 **Mekanism:** Mekanism-1.15.2-9.9.20.412</body>

		<title>Inconsistency with vanilla ores regarding Mekanism's Combiner</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: I'm reporting a duplication bug that has existed for a while and I can't see anyone else reporting on. Several 'other dimension' cyclic ores that drop multiple items do not work well with the Combiner from Mekanism. For example Redstone Nether Ore can be made in the Combiner using 3 redstone and Netherrack while normal redstone ore requires 16 Redstone and cobblestone. Same thing holds for lapis and both end version of the ores. I tried looking through the code to see which one of the two mods is responsible for this but could not find it. I'm therefore making a new issue on both githubs, the other issue can be found here: https://github.com/Lothrazar/Cyclic/issues/1354 I noticed similar issues were reported before (https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/issues/5636) but I'm guessing this is more of an actual bug then a balancing issues #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Place 3 redstone with netherrack into combiner (given you have the cyclic mod) 2. Get 1 Nether redstone ore from combiner 3. Process ore in any way you want to gain more than 3 redstone and repeat  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 14.23.5.2846 **Mekanism:** 9.8.3.390 **Other relevant version:** Cyclic 1.19.20 ![Redstone_ore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10686466/78034962-bfce9000-7368-11ea-91c9-7b13f6ea82ff.png) ![Nether_redstone_ore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10686466/78034966-c0672680-7368-11ea-8d0d-7d0fd8d15370.png) </body>

		<title>Entangloporter configuration doesn't trigger block updates</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: Quantum Entangloporters do not trigger block updates to adjacent transmitters when frequency state is updated or side configuration is modified.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Place a Quantum Entangloporter and a transmitter (of any type) adjacent. The transmitter should start off disconnected (as the Entangloporter has no current frequency). 2. Set the frequency of the Entangloporter. The transmitter should connect, but it does not unless it is broken and replaced.  Additionally, side configuration settings are ignored- transmitters will always connect if a frequency is set (and vice versa), regardless of whether that transport type for a certain side is enabled/disabled in the side configuration. This doesn't happen with other machines.  #### Version: latest dev </body>

		<title>Variable Production rates for machines</title>
		<body>*Please use the search functionality before reporting an issue. Also take a look at the closed issues!*  #### Issue description: When a machine does not have enough material or energy for it's own operation, it causes it to stutter which in turn causes huge fps drops. For example, if you have a machine using 150j/t and are only able to supply 50j/t, the machine will start start turning on and off really fast "stuttering" when it reaches enough energy to produce the item. This issue is also prevalent with more advanced tier gas using/producing machines where having different production rates causes multiple machines to stutter (x4 ore processing setup).  -an easy way to fix this issue is to add a certain delay to machines so that they are only able to turn on an off once every half second, this helps reduce the load on the computer.  -eventually a variable rate production may be implemented where a machine will only produce the amount of material that is needed or at a rate by which the power is supplied  -this is similar to the enhancement in #5784  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge: 31.1.0**  **Mekanism: 9.9.8** </body>

		<title>Fix glow for fluid tank item rendering</title>
		<body>#### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 30.0.50 **Mekanism:** 9.9.3-&gt;9.9.4 dev  Rendering of things like lava in a fluid tank in first person does not show any glow. This has to do with things now being batched, and our GL changes not being taken into account. We may be able to add the glow vertex data to `MekanismRenderer#renderObject` and the inner methods. It might be worth while to also just fully remove our custom glow handling in exchange for trying to do it via vertex data/just disabling the lightmap if it is a fullbright glow.</body>

		<title>electrolytic separator, gas generator, energy storage.</title>
		<body>*Please use the search functionality before reporting an issue. Also take a look at the closed issues!*  #### Issue description: The electrolytic separator has a weird power usage using upgrades, for example, a stock separator uses 400j/t and produces the same amount in hydrogen that the gas generator is burning. If all 8 energy upgrades are installed, the energy usage is reduced to 40j/t while the gas production stays the same. (energy is produced) Things start to get wacky once speed upgrades are added, once 4 upgrades are installed, the energy produced in hydrogen and used by the seperator are around the same. and then gets really inefficient with all 8 upgrades. I know that hydrogen is supposed to be more of a hydrogen storage rather than a producer.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. connect the seperator to a creative power cube, 2. connect the gas generator to an empty creative power cube 3. connect the hydrogen gas side to the gas generator 4. Install the 8 energy upgrades 5. the energy used, produced values are out of whack  Ratios with 8 energy upgrades: 0 speed: 40j-400j, 1000% efficiancy 360j produced 1 speed: 142j-800j, 563% efficiancy 658j produced 2 speed: 506j-1600j, 316% efficiancy 1094j produced 3 speed: 1.8kj- 4 speed: 6.4kj-6.4kj, 100% efficiancy, all energy equals out 5 speed+: inefficient  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:**  **Mekanism: 9.9.3**  **Other relevant version:**   #### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here: (_It's almost always relevant_)  [[gist](https://gist.github.com/) / [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) / etc link here.

		<title>Induction cell values when displayed in RF is wrong</title>
		<body>Hello guys !  When I set the energy in "RF", the induction cell capacity display is wrong : Basic one is 400 MRF, ok. Advanced one is 2.14GRF, ok. But the elite and ultimate one are still at 2.14GRF so that's a big problem, when i put those in induction matrix (elite or ultimate ones), the green charging bar does not display (if we consider that the maximum capacity is 2.14GRF), and the displayed maximum energy is 2.14GRF, even if i have 4 ultimate induction cell.  When i set the energy in "Joules", all is OK, it works well. That's very disapointing :/  Tell me if you want some screenshot</body>

		<body>All Mekanism machines are based on a 1:8 ratio except the Osmium Compressor which is based on a a 1:8000000000001 ratio which means that every single time you use the machine it ends at 99.99% and jammed up. I have have played with this mod for near a decade (and I love it, I think Aiden made a mod for people who just love to have fun) but this specific issue is not new. I don't even care, I only need a few ingots for high level tech, but it just seems stupid to break your own mechanics and not have machines work correctly. Minecraft has infinite ore, if you decide to make anything more arbitrarily shitty...  Bro, why? </body>

		<title>Duplication</title>
		<body>Mekanism logistical pipes (mainly advanced/elite) cause lootbag duplication when connected to Lootbag Storage block.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Get 1 Lootbag Storage block, 1 advanced/elite logistical pipe, 1 vanilla chest, and a few lootbags to put into storage (just to get something to pull out). 2. Note the lootbag value.  Set storage to a bag you can pull out given the lootbag value you've placed into it. 3. Hook up the pipe between the storage block and chest.  Set the side of the pipe facing the storage to pull. 4. Observe the multiple bags of the selected type being pulled into the chest and compare to the value being deducted from the storage block.  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge: 1.12.2-14.23.5.2807-universal**  **Mekanism: 1.12.2-9.7.9.380**  **Other relevant version: LootBags-1.12.2-2.5.8.5**   [gist/pastebin/etc link here] Lootbag: https://github.com/Malorolam/LootBags/issues/155  Thanks for your time. </body>

		<title>Negative energy capacity for network of universal cables</title>
		<body>#### Issue description:  When too many universal cable are placed, the capacity of the energy network goes negative and no energy can flow through.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Place down 6710 ultimate universal cables (I used worldedit) 2. Place down one more cable and the capacity of the network becomes negative  #### Versions: **Forge:** 14.23.5.2836 **Mekanism:** 9.8.0.381  From what i've seen, i think the problem is here. https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/blob/be8635ba17f8565191a4e8ae5f6d7e485c5aeef4/src/main/java/mekanism/api/transmitters/DynamicNetwork.java#L258 The calculated capacity of the network isn't clamped to the int that it uses. And if i use `MekanismUtils.clampToInt` to clamp it, the problem is fixed (I don't think it's the right function to use though since this is in the api). </body>

		<title>Teleporter status can desync</title>
		<body>Status updates are only sent to players within a 40 block radius: https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/blob/0701203bb996160a16805b41dcfec292b665f0cd/src/main/java/mekanism/common/tile/TileEntityTeleporter.java#L165 Instead it should probably be `sendToAllTracking`.  How to reproduce: - Have player 1 stand more than 40 blocks away from the teleporter but still close enough for it to be loaded - Activate teleporter with player 2 - Observe incorrect state for player 1 until another update is triggered  (Note: I haven't actually tried those steps. I just ran across it while adding compatibility for the teleporter to a different mod.)</body>

		<title>Mekanism causing crash because of sound handler</title>
		<body>o guys.. I've been expierencing random crashes and it tells me that the cause is "Mekanism" and "Random things" anyone know what I could do? https://paste.dimdev.org/heqasinoni.mccrash  err one "workaround/fix" would be in the config for the client section turn enablePlayerSounds to false and I believe that will stop it (as that should stop the sound events that are crashing from ever being fired). From the looks of it, my guess is that sometimes somehow the player it is trying to play the sounds for is null (might happen if a mob has a jetpack unsure, also unsure how the mob would get the jetpack)</body>

		<title>Mechanical pipe not pulling from quantum entangloporter</title>
		<body>I have the same issue as a previously closed one, #5100   ![mek_entanglo_no_pull](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5643061/60569197-f620a580-9d2b-11e9-9501-0d628ac07378.PNG)  As you can see, I have ult mech pipes pulling from a creative tank going into a quantum entangloporter (all sides set as input), then another quantum entangloporter on the same channel (all sides set as output) where ult mech pipes _should_ be pulling and sending water to a fluid trash can. This is not happening.  Mods: Mekanism 9.7.8.379 Mekanism: Generators 9.7.8.379 Just Enough Items 4.15.0.268 Extra Utilities 2 1.9.9 Forge 14.23.5.2838</body>

		<title>Precision sawmill does not accept torches or ladders via automated input</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: Precision sawmill does not accept torches or ladders via automated input.  It work manually, but not via hoppers, etc.  All other materials work using automated methods  #### Steps to reproduce: 1.  Put hopper on top of precision sawmill.  2.  Put torches in hopper 3.  Headdesk  It looks like you didn't add any custom recipe handlers for itemstacks &gt; 1, so it only accepts automated input of itemstacks of 1, which of course breaks the torches and ladders input when automated, or such is my guess when looking at the code. </body>

		<title>PRC not accepting Biofuel</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: PRC will not accept biofuel from logistic pipes, but will accept substrate. Sides are configured correctly, and pipe is pulling from chest with biofuel, but no biofuel is moved into pipes and into PRC. Substrate WILL be pulled into PRC however, which is odd, but means my setup is definably working.  This is becoming a problem as I'd like to begin making Ethelene but have to manually put in biofuel to get ethylene, a stack at a time. Hoppers also do not work, nor do other mods transport pipe options, and because substrate IS being inserted, the pipes and the PRC are set up properly. The PRC DOES make ethylene, but I can't automatically insert biofuel.  I really feel as if this is due to some other mod I added recently, because I had it working before. Since, I have added and removed a few mods, along with updating everything and started a new world. I have no idea what mod could even affect this.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Hook up a pipe that should pump biofuel into the PRC (PRC can be completely empty of have water/hydrogen in already) 2. Notice the lack of biofuel in PRC 3. Put substrate into chest with biofuel. Watch it go through pipes and into PRC  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:**   forge-14.23.5.2836 **Mekanism:** Mekanism-1.12.2-9.7.7.378 **Other relevant version:**  </body>

		<title>Fluid dupe with Inspirations mod</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: It's possible to create unlimited quantities of any fluid when using both Mekanism and Inspirations.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Put some fluid in a cauldron 2. Attach an elite mechanical pipe to the cauldron, and set it to extract from it 3. "Prime" the pipe by adding fluid to the cauldron until the pipe is full and the cauldron stops draining. This will take 17 buckets: 16 to fill the pipe and 1 more to fill the cauldron 4. Connect the other end of the pipe to something that uses less than 1000mB of that fluid at a time  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 14.23.5.2831 **Mekanism:** 9.7.7.378 **Other relevant version:** Inspirations 0.2.4  #### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here: (_It's almost always relevant_)  Nothing appears in the log about the dupe.  ----  The cause of this problem is here: https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/blob/0d4b50908f1b8a5334b436d243f2cb97b014d687/src/main/java/mekanism/common/tile/transmitter/TileEntityMechanicalPipe.java#L60-L62  First, we call `container.drain(1600, false)` on the cauldron to see how much fluid it will give us. It only has 1000mB in it, so it returns a FluidStack with an amount of 1000. Next, we call `takeFluid(1000, true)` to try to put all 1000mB in the pipe. Suppose that there's 15800mB in the pipe, so it can only hold 200mB more. Now, `takeFluid` will only add 200mB (since that's all that fits), and will thus return 200. Finally, we call `container.drain(200, true)` to remove the fluid from the cauldron. Since the cauldron doesn't have the granularity to remove only 200mB of fluid, that returns 0 and it removes nothing. Our mistake is that we ignore the result of that call and let the fluid be added to the pipe anyway.</body>

		<title>Mekanism universal cables don't give enough energy to IC2 machines</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: In the latest release of Mekanism, the universal cables don't give enough energy to IC2 machines.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Grab any IC2 machine (I use the electric furnace but anything works) 2. Plop in some overclockers to make it consume a bit of energy (something like 20 is enough) 3. Connect a Mekanism universal cable to power it 4. And the machine shouldn't have enough power to run continuously (like it did before 9.7.3.374)  #### Versions: **Forge:** 14.23.5.2836 **Mekanism:** 9.7.3.374 **IC2:** 2.8.145-ex112  From my understanding, the problem comes from this commit https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/b3663a37a958328156eba8b08ec4e7e19e04ebee, and this line of code https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/blob/faef15691ca71472a1e3732e554ea64bf30d478b/src/main/java/mekanism/common/base/EnergyAcceptorWrapper.java#L145 The simulated energy transfer isn't converted back to the proper unit and is returned as EU, changing the line to ```return fromEU(toTransfer);``` seems to fix the issue. </body>

		<title>Formulaic Assemblicator consume items with transformDamage added by crafttweaker...</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: During somes tests, I fond a problem with the Formulaic Assemblicator or possibly 2 different problem; - First, I have add somes recipe for somes Mystical Agriculture Infusion Crystal (created by ContentTweaker) make with Crafttweaker. When I try the recipe in a regular craftting table, the crystal stay in the grid but get damage... In the Formulaic Assemblicator, the crystal is simply consume when making the first set of Essence... You can see the issue in video: https://streamable.com/x3slq And heres the crafting recipe: ``` var crystals = [     &lt;contenttweaker:infusioncrystal_tier0:*&gt;.transformDamage(),     &lt;contenttweaker:infusioncrystal_tier1:*&gt;.transformDamage(),     &lt;contenttweaker:infusioncrystal_tier2:*&gt;.transformDamage(),     &lt;contenttweaker:infusioncrystal_tier3:*&gt;.transformDamage(),     &lt;contenttweaker:infusioncrystal_tier4:*&gt;.transformDamage() ] as IIngredient[];  recipes.addShaped("mystical_prudentium", &lt;mysticalagriculture:crafting:1&gt;,     [[null, &lt;mysticalagriculture:crafting&gt;, null],      [&lt;mysticalagriculture:crafting&gt;, crystals[0]|crystals[1]|crystals[2]|crystals[3]|crystals[4] , &lt;mysticalagriculture:crafting&gt;],      [null, &lt;mysticalagriculture:crafting&gt;, null]]); ``` - With the basic Infusion Crystal from Mystical Agriculture, the crystal should probably stay in the grid, but this one goes in the output slot after making the first craft, making the automation really annoying. Here a demonstration video: https://streamable.com/2z056  If you want to test with added recipe, you can simply copy my code and use a sword or thing like that at the place of the crystal and I think it will do the exact same issue.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a recipe with transformDamage in Crafttweaker 2. Try to craft in the Formulaic Assemblicator 3. Enjoy your item waste!  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 14.23.5.2824 **Mekanism:** 9.7.1.371 **Other relevant version:** Crafttweaker: 4.1.17  #### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here:  There have no crash and I no logs for that. But if needed I can send you more informations or scripts from my modpack if it can help...  Thank's for you amazing work, and making Mekanism great again! Your team is awesome! Long life to Mekanism!! Fireztonez</body>

		<title>Mekanism Versioning</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: Mekanism versioning isn't good if somebody want to use it for dependencies because prefixing the Minecraft version is bad.  Forge allows to be define a minium version of a mod as requiring, for example:  ``` @Mod(modid = SodiumCraft.MODID, version = SodiumCraft.VERSION, dependencies="required-after:mekanism@[9.4,);required-after:thermalexpansion@[5.3,)") ```  On Mekanism, we should now require defining something like   ``` dependencies="required-after:mekanism@[1.12.2-9.4,)") ```  But If I support multiple Minecraft version like 1.11 and 1.12 or some minor versions, e.g. its nearly impossible to use a constant minimum-version.  Other Mods like ThermalExpansion do not use mc verson as prefix, too.  ``` $ unzip -q -c Mekanism-1.12.2-9.4.3.330.jar mcmod.info | grep '"version"'   "version": "1.12.2-9.4.3.330",  $ unzip -q -c ThermalExpansion-1.12.2-5.3.7.31-universal.jar mcmod.info | grep '"version"'                 "version": "5.3.7.31", ```</body>

The Electrolytic Separator was the only machine to not receive a boost in efficiency in order to prevent an infinite energy loop using Hydrogen Gas.

		<body>*Please use the search functionality before reporting an issue. Also take a look at the closed issues!*  #### Issue description: Chargepad does not load static devices, although it has a connection, even if the Chargepad itself is connected to the power supply and should work as a relay/transmitter. In the http://wiki.aidancbrady.com/wiki/Chargepad statement, "Any rechargeable item you have in your inventory will be charged while standing on it." Unfortunately, when standing on a charger with a discharged Configurator, it is not charged.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Check why the rear Chargepad connector does not have power. 2.  Check if the Configurator is in the inventory or in the hand is not charging while standing on Chargepad. 3.  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 1.12.1 **Mekanism:** 1.12.1 **Other relevant version:    #### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here: (_It's almost always relevant_)  [gist/pastebin/etc link here]</body>

		<title>[1.10.2] Portable Teleporter Stopped Teleporting</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: Just recently, I have become unable to teleport using the Portable teleporter. I initially thought it was something to do with the item, so I threw it away and spawned in a new (charged) one. I've also tried removing the teleporter block and replacing it with a new one. When I try to teleport to any of my private frequencies, the purple particles appear as usual, but then the particles just keep spawning, and I never get teleported. I tried teleporting with a teleporter frame, and it works instantly, so the issue is only with the portable teleporter.  I am not sure what changed between it working and not working. I know that a couple of times before, this happened, and a simple rejoin fixed it. This time, rejoining and restarting the server has not resolved the issue.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Use portable teleporter 2. Select frequency 3. Press teleport 4. Particles appear 5. Wait for teleport 6. Keep waiting 7. Never teleport  #### Version: **Forge: 12.18.3.2422** **Mekanism: 9.2.3**  #### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here: (_It's almost always relevant_) Both the server log and client log have zero errors/warnings/notices as it doesn't output anything when the issue happens, so I'm afraid this might be hard to track down.  Edit: I'll upload both the server and client logs when I get them anyway.</body>

		<title>[1.11.2] Logistical Sorter item filtering issue</title>
		<body>#### Issue description: Using the logistical sorter to sort the drops from a mob farm and I've run into an issue when trying to send items like bows ect which are damaged to a different location it will only filter the exact bow that was used to create the filter because it's using the metadata from that item.  With a bow filter in place it will send the bow or those with identical metadata to the correct storage but at the same time it also wont send the other bows to the other storage which is currently set to take everything not filtered so the bows will just sit in the original storage.  I found a &lt;a href="https://github.com/aidancbrady/Mekanism/issues/992"&gt;similar issue from 2014&lt;/a&gt; where a subtype check was added but this doesn't seem to be an option in the logistical sorter anymore.  #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Place storage. 2. Place logistical sorter pulling from the storage. 3. Place logistical transporters connecting the sorter to two more storage and paint the transporters different colours. 4. Set the sorters default filter to 1 of the colours then create a filter for bows set to the 2nd colour. 5. Add some random items and bows with different metadata to the first storage. 6. The random items will now be in the 2nd storage and any bows with the same metadata as the original will be in the 3rd storage all the remaining bows will still be in the first storage.  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 13.20.1.2454 **Mekanism:** 9.3.4 **Other relevant version:** </body>

		<title>flamethrower not aiming correctly</title>

		<body>Issue description:  1. Unsure if this has always been like this, but seems odd: Personal Chest only allows right-clicking 2. Precision Saw Mill does not contain recipes for any wood log variants (planks seem to work) and will not process normal wood logs, including any wood (planks are fine; does not touch fences/doors/other wooden items from other mods but idk if that's always been the case) from mods like BOP &amp; Forestry. 3. Again unsure if this was chosen to be like this, but the Creative Energy Cube when (for example) spawned in does not contain power, which makes it hard to test machinery without creating power first/using an energy tablet.   Steps to reproduce:  1.  When the Personal Chest is open, you can't move any blocks both in your inventory and the chest via left click like you normally would, only right click, 2. http://imgur.com/a/YixIy &gt; shows sawmill not working. 3. http://imgur.com/a/zPlx2 &gt; no energy in cube.

		<title>Thermal Evaporation Plant Issue</title>
		<body>*Please use the search functionality before reporting an issue. Also take a look at the closed issues!*  #### Issue description: I am having an issue with the Thermal evaporation plant in the mod. Since the game updates every block that is part of the plant when it (the game) starts up, it is causing a huge, and i mean huge, lag spike. Since i put 2 next to each other in the ore processing facility that i was building, and my game crashed (Because i was adding some levels to the TEP) when i was right beside them, now everytime i try to enter the world i was in, the game lags so hard that it crashes without letting me move an inch. Is there a way i can solve this or deactivate the TEP temporarily so i can move all that stuff to other chunk? I'm worried because the only thing left to try is to take out the whole mod from the game and that would destroy at least an 80% percent of the things i have built already.   #### Steps to reproduce: 1. Setup two thermal evaporation plants, with a height of 14 blocks 2. Destroy the thermal evaporation controller and add extra levels (5 in my case) 3. Place the thermal evaporation controllers again   #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:**  **Mekanism:**  **Other relevant version:**   #### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here: (_It's almost always relevant_)  [gist/pastebin/etc link here]</body>

		<body>#### Issue description:  Hello! A few days ago, our official pack server started crashing whenever someone is near a Mekanism machine (tested with a Metallurgic Infuser and Enrichment Chamber). At first we thought that it was all due to Mekanism, but today we figured out that it doesn't happen when the crafting recipes in JEI bug out, as it sometimes happens with the 1.11.2 version. Then we tried changing the JEI version on the client back to the version where all was fine, but it didn't help. Either way, by the crash log we can tell that it has something to do with Mekanism.  #### Version (make sure you are on the latest version before reporting): **Forge:** 13.20.0.2315 **Mekanism:** 9.3.2.307 **JEI (if it actually has to do with it)** 4.5.0.289  #### If a (crash)log is relevant for this issue, link it here: (_It's almost always relevant_)  https://paste.ee/p/a1wzk</body>

		<title>[1.11.2] Logistical Transporters try to insert items into bins from bottom (and fail)</title>
		<body>Hey there, I have been building a room with bins as a storage room, connected with logistical transporters to an input-chest. See picture below for setup :D The lower bins have their inputs connected from the top (as it should be), the upper bins have been disconnected from the logistical transporters that lead to the lower bins with the configurator (set to "NONE") as they are not supposed to output any items via pipe. For the upper bins there is another pipe, leading alongside the top sides of those bins (as intended). The bug now is, that the pipe tries to fill the bins from the bottom and fail. The bins won't accept items from that side but the pipe is stubborn and tries endless. New items that are sent into the system, will also go the wrong way. For the bins in the bottom row everything works fine. Is it a bug in the pipe-system or in the bins? Disassembling the corresponding piece of pipe results in itemloss. I've lost 1000 redstones that way because i thought it'd drop into my face when disassembling the buggy piece of pipe. I could of course add a block in between the upper bins and the pipe for the lower bins to achieve the upper ones not beeing connected to the lower bins' pipes, but the setup I've built worked in older versions, so it should still do? The chest you can see at the end of the setup normally is not there. Build it for debugging attempts. It does not affect the outcome, still happens without the chest attached.

		<title>Inconsistency with Factory power consumption</title>
		<body>Hi,  As I can see in the source code (and have verified this in a quick game test), the factory blocks all have a flat energy consumption of 50 * numberOfProcessingQueues (e,g 50 * 3 for Basic Factory). This makes sense for the basic machines like the Smelter and Crusher, but for machines like the Chemical Injection Chamber which consume much more than the basic machines, this one-for-all formula introduces balancing issues.  Consider replacing the config option of "FactoryUsage" with a consumption *multiplier* instead? Perhaps with a default value of 1.0 - meaning that each queue of a Factory consumes 1.0 * the original energy consumption. So the basic machine factories would still be the same, but the advanced ones would scale to their original energy rates appropriately.  I've noticed you haven't done any activity on 1.7.10 for a while, which is what we're using. If you like this idea but aren't interested in updating old Mekanism, can I fork it and make the change for our modpack - sending a PR back when done?  Cheers</body>

		<title>[1.10.2] Digital Miner with Anchor Upgrade does not keep dimension loaded</title>
		<body>I put an anchor upgrade into a digital miner and left it in an RFtools dimension. As soon as I teleported out of the dimension, I took a look at the ender chest it was dumping into, and I saw a few ores, then the ores stopped, then the server console showed the lines indicating the dimension had unloaded.  I expected the miner to do the necessary to keep the chunk(s) it is mining chunkloaded, and keep the dimension it is in loaded as well.</body>

		<title>Max size Induction Matrix (18x18x18) Causes Server Lag</title>
		<body>This isn't the first Mekanism multiblock to cause server lag. We've previously taken down all the salination towers for a similar reason, but the extent that the Induction Matrix causes lag is far, far greater.  `TPS: 14.1                            Single Entity | Time/Tick |     % TileEntityInductionPort {2792,59,5431}:0 |     2.036 | 4.927         TileCustomCable {2793,76,5446}:0 |     1.010 | 2.445         TileCustomCable {2793,76,5433}:0 |     0.996 | 2.411 TileEntityInductionPort {2808,59,5432}:0 |     0.976 | 2.361 TileEntityInductionPort {2807,74,5448}:0 |     0.975 | 2.359       Chunk | Time/Tick |      % 0: 174, 339 |     6.168 | 15.034 0: 174, 340 |     5.074 | 12.367 0: 175, 339 |     4.070 |  9.920 0: 175, 340 |     4.044 |  9.856     0: 0, 9 |     0.805 |  1.961           All Entities of Type | Time/Tick |      %        TileEntityInductionPort |    16.361 | 39.878                TileCustomCable |     2.092 |  5.098              TileConduitBundle |     1.654 |  4.032 TileMultipartContainer$Ticking |     1.321 |  3.220            monster.EntityWitch |     1.001 |  2.439   Average Entity of Type | Time/tick | Calls  TileEntityInductionPort |     0.824 |  2800 TileEntityWeatherStation |     0.116 |    88      tile.TileController |     0.088 |   987          EntityButterfly |     0.070 |   141      TileExternalStorage |     0.067 |   705`  The difference between having that thing loaded or not is night and day. Since the lag seems to be concentrated at the induction ports, look to the code that adds energy and see what an 18x18x18 matrix filled with Ultimate cells does. I think you'll find a serious inefficiency there.  This is with the latest—as of today—version. The Avant 3 pack got it's 1.16 update JUST to make sure this hadn't been fixed.</body>

		<title>Logistical transporter - some items won't cross chunk boundary</title>
		<body>Just ran into a very odd issue: had a vanilla chest that was getting Sulfur Ore (Railcraft) and Iron Ore inserted into it from another mod (Immersive Engineering Excavator, but that isn't relevent: I replicated it without IE stuff anywhere near). Connected the chest to an Entangloporter via a Basic Logistical Transporter and configured the chest end to pull, and found that it was pulling the Sulfur and dirt out of the chest, but would not pull Iron Ore or grassy dirt. I checked the destination, and there was plenty of room in the output inventory. If the last item in the input chest was grassy dirt or Iron Ore, it wouldn't pull anything into the Entangloporter.   I tried removing and replacing all components several times, and made sure nothing was colour-coded with the configurator, but no joy.  I've used the same setup dozens of times with no problems, so it took me a while to spot what I'd done differently: the chest and the Entangloporter were separated by a chunk boundary. Both chunks were chunkloaded, but moving the entangloporter to the same chunk caused the pipe to start dragging out everything properly.</body>

		<body>we have an induction matrix that stands in 4 different chunks (unintentionally). If one clicks on a block you only get the information about in/output that occurs in the same chunk. So if you have an input in chunk X and an output in chunk Y you and click on a block in chunk Z, you won't get any information at all, if you click on a block that is in chunk X you'll only get the input and for Y you'll only get the output.

		<title>FPS Tanked w/ Logistics Pipes + Mek Bins</title>
		<body>Suffering major FPS drops [like 90%+ drops] when using ultimate logistical transporters + Mekanism bins.   Not sure if it is flooding rendering updates or what but it is only with the bins as the logistics pipes by themselves don't cause it even when transferring insane amounts of items to say... 10 overclocked recyclers. Ran into something like this with Pressure Pipes tanks when using the tank indicator and bdew tracked the problem to his rendering update code firing waaaay too much as the tank indicator was constantly changing as the tank filled and I believe he said something about "complex models" being within a 16x16x16 range around the tank indicator, ie models that have rendering updates often/constantly if that helps.  I don't have this issue using Storage Drawers or any other storage systems.  Mekanism 9.1.1 MC 1.10.2 Forge 2065  Thanks </body>

		<title>Industrial Turbine UI inconsistency</title>
		<body>Sometime the turbine UI will show me the total steam flow rate and power generation, other times it will divide that by the number of ports.  Example: I have a reactor running at injection 20, generating ~750B of steam into a turbine with 2 ports. When I first built the turbine, it reported flow of 749488 mB/t  and production of 23.55 MRF. If I quit and restart Minecraft, those numbers will change to 385339 mB/t and 12.11 MRF. It's still outputting 23.55 MRF, it just shows the wrong number in the UI. Breaking and reforming the turbine causes the correct number to appear.  Mekanism 9.0.2.271 </body>

		<title>Crash with teleporter at lowest level</title>
		<body>When placing a Teleporter block at the lowest level possible in the End, the client crashes. When doing this on a server the server does not crash, but as soon as the affected client rejoins they crash as the block is placed successfully. This does not happen if the Teleporter is placed one block above the lowest level.

		<body>https://github.com/BevoTechPack/BevoTechPack/issues/588  Mekanism-1.7.10-7.1.1.105.jar  If you insert a gas tank with oxygen in a puri chamber it takes the 200 oxygen to fill the buffer and then consumes no more even when processing ores.  This is with and without speed/energy upgrades.  Also does the same with Electro Sep. </body>

		<title>Mekanism Power causing crash with Applied Energistics 2</title>
		<body>Hi,  I've encountered an issue with Mek power and AE2 ME Networks systems. Below is the crash report. Happens in SP and multiplayer.  Forge 1191 AE2 rv0-stable-10 Mek 7.0.0.87  Game doesn't crash per-say but freezes (no actual crash report). In multiplayer the server goes into overload (200+% CPU) and no crash log is generated.  FYI I'm still getting that weird bug with MEK items placed by other players showing up as incorrect tiles. Will record it and upload it to youtube to show you. I hope the below helps. If not please let me know where to look as I can reproduce the issue very quickly.  in short this is what the AE2 guys said was the problem:  java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: readerIndex(18) + length(4) exceeds writerIndex(18): UnpooledHeapByteBuf(ridx: 18, widx: 18, cap: 18/35)         at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.checkReadableBytes(AbstractByteBuf.java:1160)         at io.netty.buffer.AbstractByteBuf.readInt(AbstractByteBuf.java:611)         at mekanism.generators.common.tile.TileEntityHeatGenerator.handlePacketData(TileEntityHeatGenerator.java:240)  full report below.  ---  net.minecraft.inventory.ISidedInventory [07:52:10] [Client thread/ERROR] [ForgeMultipart]: Trait already registered for net.minecraft.inventory.ISidedInventory [07:52:10] [Client thread/ERROR] [ForgeMultipart]: Trait already registered for buildcraft.api.power.IPowerReceptor [07:52:10] [Client thread/ERROR] [ForgeMultipart]: Trait already registered for buildcraft.api.power.IPowerReceptor [07:52:10] [Client thread/ERROR] [ForgeMultipart]: Trait already registered for net.minecraftforge.fluids.IFluidHandler [07:52:10] [Client thread/ERROR] [ForgeMultipart]: Trait already registered for net.minecraftforge.fluids.IFluidHandler [AirInspector] appeng.tile.networking.TileCableBus.cleanup() [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerISidedInventory_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 5530 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIFluidHandler_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 2441 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerITileStorageMonitorable_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 1070 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIEnergySink_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 4248 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIEnergySource_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 4184 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIPowerEmitter_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 863 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIPowerReceptor_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 1497 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIBatteryProvider_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 966 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIPipeConnection_TileCableBus loaded successfully - 1354 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerISidedInventory_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 5542 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIFluidHandler_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 2453 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerITileStorageMonitorable_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 1082 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIEnergySink_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 4260 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIEnergySource_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 4196 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIPowerEmitter_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 875 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIPowerReceptor_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 1509 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIBatteryProvider_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 978 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Layer: appeng/parts/layers/LayerIPipeConnection_TileCableBusTESR loaded successfully - 1366 bytes [07:52:10] [Client thread/WARN] [AE2:C]: Unable to regsiter a recipe:Unable to find item: appliedenergistics2:ItemMaterial.WoodenGear:0 [07:52:10] [Client thread/WARN] [AE2:C]: Unable to regsiter a recipe:Unable to find item: appliedenergistics2:ItemMaterial.GoldDust:0 [07:52:10] [Client thread/WARN] [AE2:C]: Unable to regsiter a recipe:Unable to find item: appliedenergistics2:ItemMaterial.IronDust:0 [07:52:10] [Client thread/INFO] [AE2:C]: Recipes Loading: Smelt: 4 loaded.

		<title>The evil TileEntity cast crash bug</title>
		<body>When I attempted to right click on a Mekanism machine (I think it was electrolytic separator) with a block in my hand (I believe it was clear glass from tinker's constructs) in my single player world, the client crashed to desktop. Upon reload, my world no longer appeared in the select world list, and several attempt to recover it have failed.  The world still appears in the "saves" folder however. All the files, region data, etc are still there as well. The only thing that seems to be missing is level.dat, a rather important file. copying and renaming "level.dat_mcr" to "level.dat" in an attempt to get minecraft to ask me to update to anvil format didn't work.  This is a major issue if a silly mistake like that can make your world unplayable.  For reference I'm playing on the most recent public version of the CrackPack through the ATLauncher. I've reported the issue there as well: github.com/sciguyryan/TheCrackPack/issues/41#issuecomment-44373747  pastebin to crash report: http://pastebin.com/hvjJrdwQ  Here's the top section of the crash report for convenience:  ---- Minecraft Crash Report ---- // I'm sorry, Dave.

		<title>(BUG - Induction Wires) Super charged free power from RF to Energy Cubes.</title>
		<body>MC 1.6.4 Forge 953 Mekanism 592 Thermal Expansion 3.0.0.8a (or something) Big Reactors 2.4a  So I have tested this with Mekanism power generators as well as Thermal Expansion Generators and Big Reactors. The problem consistently occurs when converting power from Redstone Flux to Joules/Mega-Joules over Mekanism Induction wires. I have checked this with Universal Cable, no problem there... behaves normally.  Here's the setup: ![2013-12-04_22 13 43](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4295188/1679995/c524ebe2-5d64-11e3-8463-d0faf6d64ead.png) Real simple setup. Two seperate Ultimate Energy Cubes, both completely empty. The one on the left is hooked up to a Redstone Energy Cell via Universal Cable. The one on the right is hooked up to the same size cell (both 100% full), but using Silver Induction Cable instead of Universal Cable.  The moment I put the RF Energy Cell on the left down,it starts charging the left Ultimate Energy Cube at a steady pace. (The below screenshot represents the RF Energy Cell once the Ultimate Energy Cube was at 10 MJ capacity out of 128 max.) ![2013-12-04_22 15 55](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4295188/1680006/1eecb3d0-5d65-11e3-93fa-b8952311c20b.png)   The instant I put down the RF Energy Cell on the right... it shoots to max power of 128 MJ _INSTANTLY_ while the RF Energy Cell only expends perhaps 5% power. ![2013-12-04_22 15 57](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4295188/1680011/364c3fbe-5d65-11e3-9d45-bf30697e69df.png)  This above picture shows the level of power in the RF Energy Cell on the right, AFTER the "instant super charge" has been given to the Ultimate Energy Cube that has charged it to max power of 128 MJ within the span of a half second. (Seriously.) Power is also consistently maintained going through the Ultimate Energy Cube the entire time, keeping it at a constant 127.8 MJ of power despite my running several factorie and two Digital Miners off it that had been fully tricked out. So this is not just an 'instant boost' that goes away, this ludicrous power surge is maintained.  I expect this is just a simple power conversion problem somewhere in the Induction Cables. Happens consistently across all quality levels of Induction Cables, from Copper to Silver to Iron. This should really be looked into as it basically means that you can power an entire base off a single ThermEx Steam Dynamo... just because you put 1 segment of Silver Induction Cable between it and your Energy Cube.  Hope this helps, let me know if you need more testing and screenshots. </body>

		<title>Energy Dupe with MFFS</title>
		<body>I'm not sure if this is your universal cable's problem or my machine's problem. As far as I know, I spent a quite long time figuring this out any it doesn't seem to be on my side.  Infinite energy dupe. http://puu.sh/5wDD5.jpg  The energy dupe does NOT happen when I change on the universal cables into conduits. http://puu.sh/5wDF4.jpg  We can re-add in the RI wires to see if the RI wires will cause a dupe. If the RI wires don't cause a dupe bug, it might mean something's wrong with the universal cable. </body>

		<title>Non-vanilla liquids don't render in mechanical pipes</title>
		<body>Any liquid that isn't water or lava doesn't render when flowing through mechanical pipes. What's confusing to me is that every liquid I've tried (RailCraft creosote, AS steam and toxic waste, lots of MFR liquids) renders perfectly in a dynamic tank, and from a cursory glance at the pipes' and tanks' rendering code they don't seem to be handled differently. Any idea why this might be happening? </body>
